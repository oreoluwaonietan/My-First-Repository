    <h1 style="color: rgb(60, 135, 179)">Coconut Rice Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      A simple and fragrant coconut rice can be prepared in one pot using canned
      coconut milk, water, rice, and salt, with optional sugar for a hint of
      sweetness. The key to fluffy, not mushy, rice is proper rinsing and a
      resting period after cooking.

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups jasmine rice (or long-grain white rice)</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup water (or coconut water for a more intense flavor)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar (optional, for a subtle sweetness)</li>
        <li>
          Optional garnishes: toasted shredded coconut, fresh chopped cilantro,
          or a squeeze of lime juice
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Rinse the rice:</b> Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse
          under cold, running water until the water runs mostly clear. This
          removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming gluey. Drain
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combine ingredients:</b> In a medium saucepan, whisk together the
          coconut milk, water, salt, and optional sugar. Stir in the rinsed
          rice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bring to a boil:</b> Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and
          bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice
          from sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Simmer:</b>Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to low and
          cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer gently, without
          stirring or lifting the lid, for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid
          has been absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rest and fluff:</b> Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit,
          covered, for an additional 10 minutes to steam. This step is crucial
          for an even, fluffy texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Serve:</b> Uncover the pot and fluff the rice with a fork. Stir in
          any optional garnishes like cilantro or a squeeze of lime juice, then
          serve warm.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Use full-fat canned coconut milk for the best flavor and creamy
          texture; carton coconut milk is often too watered down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not stir the rice while it simmers to avoid activating the starches
          and making it sticky (like risotto).
        </li>
        <li>
          For different flavor profiles, try adding a knotted pandan leaf or
          kaffir lime leaves to the pot for an authentic Asian-style dish, or
          curry powder for an Indian twist.
